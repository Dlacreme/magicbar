# Magic Bar

Magic Bar is a light application with 0 dependency providing a search bar to search for any app available in your $PATH. It can also run any shell command and be configured to quickly start your favorites applications.

All contributions are welcomed. Issues as well but not so much.

## Config file

Your favorites and a default application can be configured using a `~.magic_bar` file. See `.magic_bar.example` for more details.
